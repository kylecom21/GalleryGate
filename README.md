## üîç What is GalleryGate?

GalleryGate is a **virtual exhibition curator**, allowing users to browse famous artworks, save their favorites, and organise them into **custom exhibitions**.  
The goal is to provide an engaging way to explore art collections and curate personalised galleries.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

2. **Create Exhibitions** ‚Äì Users can add artworks to their own virtual gallery spaces.  
3. **Save & Manage** ‚Äì Exhibitions are **saved in the browser's local storage**, allowing users to revisit their curated collections.  
4. **Artwork Details** ‚Äì Clicking on an artwork opens a modal which shows some information.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Was Built

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React + JavaScript + Axios + Swiper
- **Styling:** CSS  
- **Extras:** dotenv + Vite 


### **APIs Used**
- **Metropolitan Museum of Art API** ‚Äì Provides access to thousands of artworks.  
- **Rijksmuseum API** ‚Äì Delivers data on Dutch masterpieces.  

### **Key Challenges & Solutions**
- **Handling API inconsistencies** ‚Äì The two museum APIs structure their data differently. So I had to make sure my code catered to both APIs.
- **Managing state persistence** ‚Äì Used **local storage** to save exhibitions, ensuring users don‚Äôt lose progress when refreshing.  

##  Features

- Browse artworks from the **Metropolitan Museum of Art** and the **Rijksmuseum**.
- Filter and sort artworks by title, date, and artist.
- Spotlight feature showcasing a random artwork.
- Create, manage, and delete custom exhibitions.
- View details of each artwork in a modal popup.

---

## üíæ Data Persistence  

- Artworks are cached using local storage to improve loading speed and reduce API requests.
- Cached artworks expire after 24 hours, ensuring users get updated data regularly.
- Your exhibitions are **automatically saved** in your browser‚Äôs **local storage**.  
- This means your exhibitions **will still be there** even if you close and reopen the site.  
- However, clearing your browser‚Äôs cache **will remove** all saved exhibitions.  
- Your exhibitions **won‚Äôt sync across different devices or browsers**.
